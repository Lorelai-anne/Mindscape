This Project is about self discovery. Through the practice of mindfullness, you take a journey of answering questions along a path in a place you do not understand. As you follow the foggy path, the player gets to wander deeper and deeper into their subconcious.

## Game Description
“Mindscape” is a VR experience that transports the player into a dreamy landscape that is designed to entice self reflection and discovery. The player starts off in familiar surroundings, but as they walk further the world becomes more surreal. During this walk, they are asked various questions that induce different outcomes based on their decisions.
